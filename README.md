# E-commerce Customer Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to predict customer spending (`Yearly Amount Spent`) based on various features. The dataset includes information such as `Length of Membership`, `Time on App`, `Time on Website`, and `Avg. Session Length`.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Understand customer behavior and spending patterns.
2. Build a regression model to predict the `Yearly Amount Spent` by customers.
3. Identify key features that influence customer spending.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average time spent per session on the website.
- **Time on App**: Time spent on the mobile application.
- **Time on Website**: Time spent on the website.
- **Length of Membership**: Duration of customer membership in years.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Total spending by the customer in a year (target variable)

## Key findings
Length of Membership is the strongest predictor of customer spending.
Customers who spend more time on the app tend to have higher yearly spending.
The model predictions align well with the actual values, validating the regression model's effectiveness.
